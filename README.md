# Coreli

Coreli stand for "Collatz Research Library".               

The Collatz process is a very simple to describre: take any number $x$, if even do $x/2$ if odd do $(3x+1)/2$. Repeat.   

Starting from **5** will give you: `[5, 8, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, ...]`. Starting from **43** will give you: `[43, 65, 98, 49, 74, 37, 56, 28, 14, 7, 11, 17, 26, 13, 20, 10, 5, 8, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, ...]`.   

The **Collatz Conjecture**, unresolved since the 60s, states that, no matter which number you start from, you'll reach one.        

The appararent simplicity of this problem hides a very difficult mathematical problem. Actually, we are of the people thinking that this problem is more about **Computer Science** than anything else. That's why we created **Coreli**, a library for experimenting and testing hypothesises regarding the Collatz process.      

The features of **Coreli** are based on research which is listed below. Please browse the `example` folder to get an idea of what you can do with it.
